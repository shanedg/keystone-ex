# keystone-ex
example keystone js project, "from scratch"

## keystonejs

### from scratch
got stuck at [step 4](https://keystonejs.com/getting-started/setting-up/part-4/) of setup

### [quick start](https://github.com/shanedg/keystone-yo-ex)
tried yeoman generator [here](https://keystonejs.com/getting-started/yo-generator/) and this worked fine, though dependencies do appear to be [out of date / vulnerable](https://github.com/shanedg/keystone-yo-ex/issues/1)
